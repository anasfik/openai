<h3>Help this grow and get discovered by other devs with a ‚≠ê star.</h3>

</br>
</br>

An open-source Client package that allows developers to easily integrate the power of OpenAI's state-of-the-art AI models into their Dart/Flutter applications.

This library provides simple and intuitive methods for making requests to OpenAI's various APIs, including the GPT-3 language model, DALL-E image generation, and more.

The package is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, so you can focus on building your application, rather than worrying about the complexities and errors caused by dealing with HTTP requests.

</br>
</br>

<i>Unofficial</i>
</br>
<i>OpenAI does not have any official Dart library.</I>

### Note:

Please note that this client SDK connects directly to [OpenAI APIs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction/overview) using HTTP requests.

# üìú Full Documentation:

For the full documentation about all members this library offers, [check here](https://pub.dev/documentation/dart_openai/latest/).

</br>

# üü¢ Usage

## Authentication

### API key

The OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication. you can get your account API key by visiting [API keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) of your account.

We highly recommend loading your secret key at runtime from a `.env` file, you can use the [envied](https://pub.dev/packages/envied) package.

```
// .env
OPEN_AI_API_KEY=<REPLACE WITH YOUR API KEY>
```

```dart
// lib/env/env.dart
import 'package:envied/envied.dart';
part 'env.g.dart';

@Envied(path: ".env")
abstract class Env {
  @EnviedField(varName: 'OPEN_AI_API_KEY') // the .env variable.
  static const apiKey = _Env.apiKey;
}
```

```dart
// lib/main.dart
void main() {
 OpenAI.apiKey = Env.apiKey; // Initializes the package with that API key
 // ..
}
```

if no `apiKey` is set, and you tried to access `OpenAI.instance`, a `MissingApiKeyException` will be thrown even before making the actual request.

if the `apiKey` is set, but it is invalid when making requests, a `RequestFailedException` will be thrown in your app, check the [error handling](#error-handling) section for more info.

### Setting an organization

if you belong to a specific organization, you can pass its id to `OpenAI.organization` like this:

```dart
 OpenAI.organization = "ORGANIZATION ID";
```

If you don't belong actually to any organization, you can just ignore this section, or set it to `null`.

[Learn More From Here.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication)

</br>

## Models

### List Models

Lists the currently available models, and provides basic information about each one such as the owner and availability.

```dart
 List<OpenAIModelModel> models = await OpenAI.instance.model.list();
 OpenAIModelModel firstModel = models.first;

 print(firstModel.id); // ...
```

### Retrieve model.

Retrieves a single model by its id and gets additional pieces of information about it.

```dart
 OpenAIModelModel model = await OpenAI.instance.model.retrieve("text-davinci-003");
 print(model.id);
```

If the model id does not exist, a `RequestFailedException` will be thrown, check [Error Handling](#error-handling) section.

[Learn More From Here.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models)

</br>

## Completions

### Create completion

Creates a Completion based on the provided properties `model`, `prompt` & other properties.

```dart
OpenAICompletionModel completion = await OpenAI.instance.completion.create(
  model: "text-davinci-003",
  prompt: "Dart is a progr",
  maxTokens: 20,
  temperature: 0.5,
  n: 1,
  stop: ["\n"],
  echo: true,
);
```

if the request failed (as an example, if you did pass an invalid model id...), a `RequestFailedException` will be thrown, check [Error Handling](#error-handling) section.

### Create Completion Stream

In addition to calling the `OpenAI.instance.completion.create()` which is a `Future` and will not return an actual value until the completion is ended, you can get a `Stream` of values as they are generated:

```dart
Stream<OpenAIStreamCompletionModel> completionStream = OpenAI.instance.completion.createStream(
  model: "text-davinci-003",
  prompt: "Github is ",
  maxTokens: 100,
  temperature: 0.5,
  topP: 1,
 );

completionStream.listen((event) {
 final firstCompletionChoice = event.choices.first;
 print(firstCompletionChoice.text); // ...
});
```

</br>

## Chat (ChatGPT)

### Create chat completion

Creates a completion for the chat message, note you need to set each message as a `OpenAIChatCompletionChoiceMessageModel` object.

```dart
OpenAIChatCompletionModel chatCompletion = await OpenAI.instance.chat.create(
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages: [
      OpenAIChatCompletionChoiceMessageModel(
        content: "hello, what is Flutter and Dart ?",
        role: OpenAIChatMessageRole.user,
        ),
    ],
);
```

### Create a chat completion stream

in addition to calling `OpenAI.instance.chat.create()` which is a `Future` and will resolve only after the whole chat is generated, you can get a `Stream` of results:

```dart
Stream<OpenAIStreamChatCompletionModel> chatStream = OpenAI.instance.chat.createStream(
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages: [
      OpenAIChatCompletionChoiceMessageModel(
        content: "hello",
        role: OpenAIChatMessageRole.user,
      )
    ],
  );

chatStream.listen((streamChatCompletion) {
    final content = streamChatCompletion.choices.first.delta.content;
    print(content);
});
```

</br>

### Functions

You can use the chat functions interface with both the `Stream` and `Future` interface.
(Note that functions requires at least model `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613`)
Request:

```dart
OpenAIChatCompletionModel chatCompletion =
    await OpenAI.instance.chat.create(
      model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0613',
      messages: [
          OpenAIChatCompletionChoiceMessageModel(
              content: "What's the weather like in Boston?",
              role: OpenAIChatMessageRole.user,
          )
      ],
      temperature: 0,
      functions: [
              OpenAIFunctionModel.withParameters(
                name: 'get_current_weather',
                description: 'Get the current weather in a given location',
                parameters: [
                  OpenAIFunctionProperty.string(
                    name: 'location',
                    description: 'The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA',
                    isRequired: true,
                  ),
                  OpenAIFunctionProperty.string(
                    name: 'unit',
                    enumValues: ['celsius', 'fahrenheit']
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ],
      functionCall: FunctionCall.auto,
    );
```

The `functionalCall` parameter can be set to a specific function name to force the model to use that function:
```dart
functionCall: FunctionCall.forFunction('get_current_weather')
```

You can access the results in the `arguments` field of the `function_call` field.

```dart
FunctionCallResponse? response = chatCompletion.choices.first.message.functionCall;
String? functionName = response?.name;
Map<String, dynamic>? functionArguments = response?.arguments;
```

## Edits

### Create edit

Creates an edited version of the given prompt based on the used model.

```dart
OpenAIEditModel edit = await OpenAI.instance.edit.create(
model: "text-davinci-edit-001";
instruction: "remote all '!'from input text",
input: "Hello!!, I! need to be ! somethi!ng"
n: 1,
temperature: 0.8,
);
```

# Audio

## Create transcription

for transcribing an audio `File`, you can use the `createTranscription()` method directly by providing the `file` property:

```dart
OpenAIAudioModel transcription = OpenAI.instance.audio.createTranscription(
  file: /* THE AUDIO FILE HERE */,
  model: "whisper-1",
  responseFormat: OpenAIAudioResponseFormat.json,
);
```

## Create translation

to get access to the translation API, and translate an audio file to english, you can use the `createTranslation()` method, by providing the `file`` property:

```dart
OpenAIAudioModel translation = await OpenAI.instance.audio.createTranslation(
  file: /* THE AUDIO FILE HERE */,
  model: "whisper-1",
  responseFormat: OpenAIAudioResponseFormat.text,

);
```

</br>

## Fine Tunes

### Create fine-tune

Creates a job that fine-tunes a specified model from a given dataset, and returns a fine-tuned object about the enqueued job.

```dart
OpenAIFineTuneModel fineTune = await OpenAI.instance.fineTune.create(
 trainingFile: "FILE ID",
);

print(fineTune.status); // ...
```

### List fine-tunes

List your organization's fine-tuning jobs.

```dart
List<OpenAIFineTuneModel> fineTunes = await OpenAI.instance.fineTune.list();

print(fineTunes.first); // ...
```

### Retrieve fine-tune

Retrieves a fine-tune by its id.

```dart
OpenAIFineTuneModel fineTune = await OpenAI.instance.fineTune.retrieve("FINE TUNE ID");

print(fineTune.id); // ...
```

### Cancel fine-tune

Cancels a fine-tune job by its id, and returns it.

```dart
OpenAIFineTuneModel cancelledFineTune = await OpenAI.instance.fineTune.cancel("FINE TUNE ID");

print(cancelledFineTune.status); // ...
```

### List fine-tune events

Lists a single fine-tune progress events by it's id.

```dart
 List<OpenAIFineTuneEventModel> events = await OpenAI.instance.fineTune.listEvents("FINE TUNE ID");

 print(events.first.message); // ...
```

### Listen to fine-tune events `Stream`

Streams all events of a fine-tune job by its id, as they happen.

This is a long-running operation that will not return until the fine-tune job is terminated.

The stream will emit an event every time a new event is available.

```dart
Stream<OpenAIFineTuneEventStreamModel> eventsStream = OpenAI.instance.fineTune.listEventsStream("FINE TUNE ID");

eventsStream.listen((event) {
 print(event.message);
});
```

### Delete fine-tune

Deletes a fine-tune job by its id.

```dart
 bool deleted = await OpenAI.instance.fineTune.delete("FINE TUNE ID");

print(deleted); // ...
```

## Moderations

### Create moderation

Classifies if text violates OpenAI's Content Policy

```dart
OpenAIModerationModel moderation = await OpenAI.instance.moderation.create(
  input: "I want to kill him",
);

print(moderation.results); // ...
print(moderation.results.first.categories.hate); // ...
```

<br>

## Error Handling

Any time an error happens from the OpenAI API ends (As Example: when you try to create an image variation from a non-image file.. , a `RequestFailedException` will be thrown automatically inside your Flutter / Dart app, you can use a `try-catch` to catch that error, and make an action based on it:

```dart
try {

// This will throw an error.
 final errorVariation = await OpenAI.instance.image.variation(
  image: File(/*PATH OF NON-IMAGE FILE*/),
 );
} on RequestFailedException catch(e) {
 print(e.message);
 print(e.statusCode);
}
```
